### About
A General Purpose Discord Bot for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege designed to improve upon and run in tandem with [r6econ](https://github.com/hiibolt/r6econ), but now intended for OSINT. Includes many, many utilities for gathering open source intelligence via a variety of paid APIs in a succint, error-checked, and pretty looking package.

All sections can be placed behind a Discord User ID whitelist system, allowing selective distribution via a key system.

### Available Commands
<!-- INJECT ME -->

### Setup
While open source, I do *not* provide setup instructions. If such a tool interests you, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ENGqjywsbm) for details on purchasing access!
