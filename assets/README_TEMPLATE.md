### About
A General Purpose Discord Bot for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege designed to improve upon and run in tandem with [r6econ](https://github.com/hiibolt/r6econ), but containing multiple powerful OSINT tools. 

Includes many, many utilities for gathering open source intelligence via a variety of paid APIs in a succint, error-checked, and pretty looking package.

All sections can be placed behind a Discord User ID whitelist system, allowing selective distribution via a key system.

All commands are alternatively available as slash commands that better indicate what constitutes each argument, as well as whether a given argument is optional.

## Packaged Utilities 
- Sherlock
- BulkVS - CNAM Lookup
- Snusbase - Leak Queries
- Snusbase - Geolocation
- Snusbase - Hash Queries
- Rainbow Six Siege Social API
- Rainbow Six Siege Marketplace GraphQL API
